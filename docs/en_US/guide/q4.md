# WebSocket Connection Issues

- **Verify CDN Settings**:  
  If a CDN is being used, ensure that your CDN provider supports WebSocket services and that WebSocket functionality has been correctly enabled.

- **Check Reverse Proxy Configuration**:  
  Ensure that the following paths are correctly configured for WebSocket support in your reverse proxy rules:
  - `/api/v1/ws/server`
  - `/api/v1/ws/terminal/:id`
  - `/api/v1/ws/file/:id`

For detailed configuration instructions, refer to: [Configure Reverse Proxy](/en_US/guide/q3.html).
