# Group Management

Group management allows users to organize servers and notifications more efficiently, enhancing Dashboard readability and operational convenience.

---

## Server Groups

### Overview
Server grouping is used to categorize and manage servers in the Dashboard. Servers in the same group will be displayed under separate tabs, enabling quick access and distinction.

### Configuration Steps
1. **Access the Server Page**  
   Navigate to the server page to complete basic server configurations.

2. **Assign Groups**  
   Assign a group name to servers. Servers with the same group name will be categorized under the same tab.

### Use Cases
- **Geographical Organization**: Group servers by location, such as `China` and `Overseas`.
- **Purpose-Based Grouping**: Group servers by their roles, such as `Database` or `Web Services`.
- **Departmental Organization**: Group servers by departments, such as `R&D` or `Operations`.

## Notification Groups

### Overview
Notification groups allow users to combine multiple notification methods into a single group. These groups can be used as targets for tasks or alert notifications, enabling simultaneous multi-channel notifications.

### Configuration Steps
1. **Access the Notifications Page**  
   Configure the desired notification methods (e.g., Telegram, Email, DingTalk) on the notifications page.

2. **Create Notification Groups**  
   Add one or more notification methods into a notification group and name the group for easy identification.

3. **Apply Notification Groups**  
   Select the notification group as the target in tasks or alert rules. When triggered, notifications will be sent simultaneously through all methods in the group.

### Use Cases
- **Multi-Channel Notifications**: Receive alerts via both Telegram and Email simultaneously.
- **Priority-Based Notifications**: Set up different notification groups for various alert types or server groups (e.g., `High Priority` and `Standard Notifications`).
