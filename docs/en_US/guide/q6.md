# How to Reset Traffic Statistics Monthly?

Traffic statistics on the homepage are automatically reset when the server restarts. To implement an automatic monthly reset of traffic statistics, follow these steps:

1. **Access the Admin Panel**  
   Log in to the Dashboard and navigate to the **`Notifications`** page.

2. **Create a Monthly Traffic Alert**  
   Refer to the [Custom Cycle Traffic Alert Documentation](/en_US/guide/notifications.html) to create a traffic alert configured for monthly tracking.

3. **View Monthly Traffic Statistics**  
   Go back to the homepage and click the **`Services`** button to view the monthly traffic statistics. These statistics will not reset when the server restarts.

**Flexible Cycle Settings**  
This method supports not only monthly resets but also custom cycles like hourly, daily, weekly, or yearly resets for traffic statistics. It's highly flexible!
