# Agent Startup/Online Troubleshooting Process

If the Agent fails to go online after starting, follow these steps to identify and resolve the issue:

---

## 1. Check Network Connectivity

Use the following command to test if the local machine can connect to the Dashboard server's communication port:

```bash
nc -v <Domain/IP> <Communication Port>
# Or
telnet <Domain/IP> <Communication Port>
```

### Notes:
- If communication between the server and the Dashboard server fails:
  - Check inbound/outbound firewall rules on both the local and Dashboard servers.
  - Use a port-checking tool like <https://port.ping.pe/> to verify if the port is open.

## 2. Check SELinux Status

If the network connection is normal but the Agent is still offline, try disabling SELinux:

### Steps to Disable SELinux:
- Check the current SELinux status:
  ```bash
  sestatus
  ```
- Temporarily disable SELinux (no restart required):
  ```bash
  sudo setenforce 0
  ```
- Permanently disable SELinux:
  Edit the `/etc/selinux/config` file and change `SELINUX=enforcing` to:
  ```bash
  SELINUX=disabled
  ```
  Then restart the system.

## 3. View Agent Logs

Enable debug mode in the configuration file. Check the Agent's running status and logs using the following command:
```bash
systemctl status nezha-agent-*
```

Inspect the logs for error messages to pinpoint the cause.

## 4. Check gRPC Service Communication

Verify if the Agent can successfully connect to the gRPC service:

### Use the following command to check the gRPC service path:
```bash
curl http://<Your IP or Domain>:<Port>/proto.NezhaService/ -H "Content-Type:application/grpc" -X POST -v
```

### Example of a Normal Response:
```plain
< HTTP/2 200
< content-type: application/grpc
<
< grpc-message: unknown method  for service proto.NezhaService
< grpc-status: 12
```

### Key Information:
1. **`content-type` should be `application/grpc`**:
   - If not, it indicates that the gRPC service connection is not functioning correctly.
2. **Presence of `grpc-message` error details**:
   - A typical response includes `unknown method for service proto.NezhaService`.

### If the Check Fails:
- Review reverse proxy configurations and ensure traffic routes correctly to the Dashboard server's gRPC service.
