# Enabling GPU Monitoring

## Activating GPU Monitoring

### Via Configuration File

Enable the `gpu` parameter in the `/opt/nezha/agent/config.yml` file:
```yaml
gpu: true
```

After saving the changes, restart the Agent service to apply the configuration:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart nezha-agent.service
```

## GPU Utilization Monitoring Support

GPU model and GPU utilization are separate monitoring metrics, and their retrieval methods differ:

1. **Windows and macOS**  
   - No additional dependencies are required for monitoring GPU utilization.
   - Supports multiple GPU brands (e.g., NVIDIA, AMD).

2. **Linux**  
   - Supports only NVIDIA and AMD GPUs.
   - Requires additional drivers or tools to retrieve GPU utilization.  
   Below are specific steps to enable GPU utilization monitoring on Linux.

### NVIDIA GPUs

#### Required Tool
NVIDIA GPUs use the `nvidia-smi` tool to retrieve utilization data. This tool is typically included with the official NVIDIA driver.

#### Important Notes
- Third-party drivers (e.g., `nouveau`) are not supported for GPU utilization monitoring.
- Ensure the official NVIDIA driver is installed and that GPU data is accessible via `nvidia-smi`.

### AMD GPUs

#### Required Tool
AMD GPUs require the open-source `amdgpu` driver and the `rocm-smi` tool for utilization monitoring.

#### Installation Instructions

Use the following commands for popular Linux distributions:

```bash
# Arch Linux
pacman -Sy rocm-smi-lib

# Debian / Ubuntu
apt install rocm-smi

# Fedora / RHEL 8+
dnf install rocm-smi
```

#### Manual Installation of `rocm_smi_lib`

If your system lacks a pre-packaged version of `rocm-smi`, you can manually compile and install the `rocm_smi_lib`.

##### Prerequisites
Ensure the following tools are installed:
- `git`
- `cmake`
- `gcc`

##### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ROCm/rocm_smi_lib
   ```

2. **Compile and Install**:
   ```bash
   cd rocm_smi_lib
   mkdir -p build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make -j $(nproc)
   # Install the library and headers to the default location (/opt/rocm)
   sudo make install
   ```
